### Hi there, I'm Xianqing. ðŸ‘‹ 
An MSc candidate at UoE | A cognitive neuroscientist to be

## About me.
 

- ðŸŽ“ I am currently pursuing my PhD in Neuroscience at the **University of Iowa**. I received my MSc degree in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh where she gained research experience in neurophysiology. My research interests focus on understanding the brain networks involved in emotion and language cognition and how they are altered in mood and communication disorders, with the ultimate goal of identifying more effective and individualized neurotherapeutic targets to facilitate the development of treatments for these disorders. Aiming at these goals, I'm investigating the causal links between cortical and deep brain regions using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

- :bulb: I am passionate about research, and especially interested in figuring out the **neural mechanism behind social cognition and language**. My diverse experience includes my work as a junior neuroscientist investigating the representation and neural implementation of semantic memory, as an RA collecting and analyzing neuroscientific data in social cognition projects, and as a motivated coder teaching myself programming skills. Through my experience, I have familiarized myself with **EEG/sEEG data processing**, **Shell**, **R**, **MATLAB**, and **Python**.

- ðŸŒ± I took many detours after deciding to become a neuroscientist. However, this process led me not only to explore many interesting research topics, but also to finally find that the social and language neuroscience were directions I was willing to pursue in depth. With this goal in mind, I build up relevant knowledge and skills and put them into practice in my academic projects. I expect that through my future research and studies I will be one step closer to being a outstanding researcher.
