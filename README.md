### Hi there, I'm Xianqing. ðŸ‘‹ 
A MSc candidate at UoE | A cognitive neuroscientist to be

&emsp;<br/>


## About me.
&emsp;<br/>
&emsp;<br/>

- ðŸŽ“ I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Psychological Research at the **University of Edinburgh** and will graduate in Nov 2022. I am also a research assistant working with [Prof. Haiyan Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Haiyan-Wu-5) in [**Affective, Neuroscience and Decision-making Laboratory**](https://andlab-um.com) (**A. N. D Lab**) in the psychology program at the **University of Macau** (Macao, China).
&emsp;<br/>
&emsp;<br/>


- :bulb: I am passionate about research, and especially interested in figuring out the **neural mechanism behind human language**. My diverse experience includes my work as a junior psychologist investigating the representation and neural implementation of semantic memory, as an RA collecting and analyzing neuroscientific data, and as a motivated coder teaching myself programming skills. Through my experience, I have familiarized myself with **EEG/sEEG and fMRI data processing**, **computational modeling**, **R**, **MATLAB**, and **Python**.
&emsp;<br/>
&emsp;<br/>


- ðŸŒ± I took many detours after deciding to become a psychologist. However, this process led me not only to explore many interesting research topics, but also to finally find that the neuroscience of language was a direction I was willing to pursue in depth. With this goal in mind, I build up relevant knowledge and skills and put them into practice in my academic projects. I expect that through my future research and studies I will be one step closer to being a outstanding researcher.
