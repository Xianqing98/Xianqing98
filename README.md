### Hi there, I'm Xianqing. ðŸ‘‹ 
&emsp;<br/>
 

- ðŸŽ“ I am currently pursuing my PhD in Neuroscience at the **University of Iowa**. My research focus on understanding the **brain networks involved in emotion and language cognition** and how they are altered in **mood and communication disorders**, with the ultimate goal of identifying more effective and individualized neurotherapeutic targets to facilitate the **development of treatments** for these disorders. Aiming at these goals, I'm investigating the causal links between cortical and deep brain regions using **intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)** and **transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)**.

- :bulb: My diverse experience includes my work as a junior neuroscientist investigating the representation and neural implementation of semantic memory, as an RA collecting and analyzing neuroscientific data in social cognition projects, and as a motivated coder teaching myself programming skills. Through my experience, I have familiarized myself with **EEG/sEEG data processing**, **Shell**, **R**, **MATLAB**, and **Python**.

- ðŸŒ± I took many detours after deciding to become a neuroscientist. However, this process led me not only to explore many interesting research topics, but also to finally find that the social and language neuroscience were directions I was willing to pursue in depth. With this goal in mind, I build up relevant knowledge and skills and put them into practice in my academic projects. I expect that through my future research and studies I will be one step closer to being a outstanding researcher.
